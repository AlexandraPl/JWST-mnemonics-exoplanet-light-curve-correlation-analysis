# Investigating-Time-Correlated-Noise-in-JWST-Exoplanet-Observations
Analysis of TRAPPIST-1 light curves using correlation methods, PCA, and a neural network model. Demonstrates time-series analysis, dimensionality reduction, and machine-learning techniques applied to astrophysical data. The goal is to understand patterns in stellar brightness variations and evaluate whether machine learning models can extract meaningful physical relationships from time-series photometric data.


📌 Project Overview

The notebook includes four major stages:

1. Pearson Correlation Analysis

Computes correlation coefficients between observed brightness values.

Helps identify linear relationships and initial signal structure.

2. Autocorrelation and Time Lag Analysis

Examines periodicity and self-similarity in the time-series.

Useful for detecting repeating stellar activity or transit signatures.

3. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Reduces high-dimensional time-series data into principal components.

Reveals dominant modes of variation in the light curve.

Helps visualize and interpret structure that may not be obvious from raw data.

4. Neural Network Modeling

Builds and trains a neural network to model features in the light curve.

Demonstrates machine-learning-based pattern extraction.

Useful for classification/regression tasks on stellar or exoplanet data.
